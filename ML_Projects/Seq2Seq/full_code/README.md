# Sequence to sequence model for neural machine translation

### requirements: 
- python 3.6
- pytorch 
- nltk
- tqdm

### background 
- this repo tries to implement the paper [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215), some details differ from the original paper, though. 
- we are using data from http://www.manythings.org/anki/
